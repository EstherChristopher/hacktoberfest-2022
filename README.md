# Chaos Genius <> Aviyel Hacktoberfest 2022

We are collaborating with Aviyel to bring you Hacktoberfest 2022. This event is all about non-code contributions - specifically, technical writing.

Learn more about the event - schedule, judging criteria and rewards - [**here**](https://aviyel.com/post/3738/announcing-hacktoberfest-with-aviyel).

## What can I contribute?

In general, we will accept any form of technical writing related to Chaos Genius, business observability, anomaly detection and data cloud monitoring.
More specifically, we're looking for blog posts. We have prepared a [**small list of ideas**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJHMe_pvrmalPLgLmEwi0oztdby6Lz4d0CyKlffFzkg/edit?usp=sharing).
You can choose your own idea but be sure to let us know by opening an issue or by dropping a message in our community Slack.

## How do I submit an article?

We accept an article in these forms:
- Markdown file: if you're familiar with markdown, this will be a simple. Add your `.md` file under the [`articles`](./articles) directory and open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
- Google doc: you can submit an article as a Google Docs document too. Open [an issue](https://github.com/chaos-genius/hacktoberfest-2022/issues) with a link to your doc with sharing allowed for anyone with the link.
